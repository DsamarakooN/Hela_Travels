#### Brief Description of Project - Serendib Explorers (Pvt) Ltd is a fast-growing new travel agency in Sri Lanka and our client suggested bringing their business to the internet platform to promote it. Because of that, we decided to develop a tourism and hospitality management system. It is what we called as Serendib Explorers. Serendib Explorers will be an online platform in which travelers can plan their trips to get the best travel experience in Sri Lanka. First, we register all types of tourism services in our system. After that, we provide that service to travelers through our system. Travelers can use this platform to plan their trips from start to end.
