- Hela Travels is an online platform designed to simplify travel-related services in Sri Lanka. The application serves as a comprehensive travel guide, providing users with essential information on travel packages, destination details, hotels, and tour guides. Users can register on the platform either as a service provider or as a regular user. Regular users can explore and use the travel-related services listed on the application. On the other hand, service providers, such as hotel owners or travel businesses, can create their listings, showcasing their services to potential travelers. This feature allows them to effectively reach their target audience, thereby growing their business. Hela Travels aims to connect travelers with local businesses, fostering a vibrant travel community while promoting tourism in Sri Lanka.

## <span style="color: #25D366">Technology Stack</span>

This project was developed using the **MERN** stack, a collection of JavaScript-based technologies, along with several other key technologies:

1. <span style="color: #25D366">**MongoDB:** </span>A NoSQL database used to store application data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
2. <span style="color: #25D366">**Express.js:**</span> A back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js.
3. <span style="color: #25D366">**React.js:**</span> A JavaScript library used for building the frontend/ user interface of the application.
4. <span style="color: #25D366">**Node.js:**</span> A JavaScript runtime environment that allowed executing JavaScript on the server side.

In addition to MERN stack, the following technologies were also used:

1. <span style="color: #25D366">**Redux:**</span> Used for managing the application state in a predictable way. It helps to write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.
2. <span style="color: #25D366">**JWT (JSON Web Tokens):**</span> Employed for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. In this project, JWT is used for user authentication.
3. <span style="color: #25D366">**Firebase Firestore:**</span> Used for handling image uploads in the application. It provides cloud storage, enabling the storage and sharing of user-generated content, like images.
4. <span style="color: #25D366">**Bootstrap 5:**</span> A popular CSS framework used for designing the frontend of the application. It provides pre-designed components, which helped in building a responsive and attractive user interface.
